Sync with the project on GitHub

Before working on anything:

1. Do a pull from main branch, to make sure you are working with the newest code:
In Terminal (Command Line):
cd your_project_path
git checkout main
git pull
git checkout your_branch

2. After coding:
git add .
git commit -m “a message about what did you do”
git push

3. Go to GitHub website, go to your branch, do a pull request from your branch to main branch, so that it will merge your branch to main branch.
